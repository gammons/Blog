    %section.post-content

      %p I am the VP of Engineering at <a href="https://www.pipelinedeals.com">PipelineDeals</a>, a sales CRM platform.  During my first 3 years with the organization I was the sole engineer, delivering countless features.  I have deep technical knowledge of Ruby, Rails, Mysql, Redis, and many Devops topics.

      %p During my time as VP of Engineering, I have successfully built and scaled the <a href="https://medium.com/cto-school/ditching-scrum-for-kanban-the-best-decision-we-ve-made-as-a-team-cd1167014a6f?source=latest---------3">software delivery</a>, hiring, deployment, and devops processes.  I currently lead 3 remote teams of engineers from around the US and Poland. My efforts have helped PipelineDeals' achieve high growth and profitability, with millions of dollars in revenue and thousands of customers across the globe, despite PipelineDeals being bootstrapped for 8 years.

      %p I believe in empowering engineers to do their best work by attracting and hiring amazing people.  I care deeply about fostering a healthy team culture and achieving team happiness.  I embrace remote working and have years of experience making remote teams a success.

      %p I am the co-organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CTO-School-Philadelphia/">CTO School in Philadelphia</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@gammons">I blog frequently about engineering leadership topics</a>.

      %p I live outside of Philadelphia in an old house with my wife, 2 sons, and 2 dogs.  I am an avid runner and cook.
